# My Blog Website

This is a simple blog website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website has the following features:

- A home page that displays a welcome message and some placeholder text.
- An about page that displays some information about me and my blog.
- An articles page that displays a list of articles that I have written on various topics.
- A login page that allows users to log in to their accounts or create a new account.
- An account page that allows users to update their email and password.
- An article page that displays the content of a single article and allows users to comment on it.
